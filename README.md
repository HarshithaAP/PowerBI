🚀 Coco Chocolate Sales Analytics Dashboard - Powered by Power BI 🍫

I’m excited to share an interactive Power BI dashboard I created to provide comprehensive sales analysis for Coco Chocolate. This dashboard visually presents key metrics and insights, including:

1. Revenue, total boxes sold, profit, and shipment count.
2. Detailed performance breakdown by product and salesperson.
3. Analysis of low box shipment counts, including percentages.
4. Month-over-Month (MoM) and Year-over-Year (YoY) growth comparisons.

This project allowed me to enhance my skills in advanced visualization techniques, KPI tracking, interactive filters/slicers, and data storytelling within Power BI.
